# Feature Specification: Create Taskify

**Feature Branch**: `001-develop-taskify-a`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Develop Taskify, a team productivity platform. It should allow users to create projects, add team members, assign tasks, comment and move tasks between boards in Kanban style. In this initial phase for this feature, let's call it 'Create Taskify,' let's have multiple users but the users will be declared ahead of time, predefined. I want five users in two different categories, one product manager and four engineers. Let's create three different sample projects. Let's have the standard Kanban columns for the status of each task, such as 'To Do,' 'In Progress,' 'In Review,' and 'Done.' There will be no login for this application as this is just the very first testing thing to ensure that our basic features are set up. For each task in the UI for a task card, you should be able to change the current status of the task between the different columns in the Kanban work board. You should be able to leave an unlimited number of comments for a particular card. You should be able to, from that task card, assign one of the valid users. When you first launch Taskify, it's going to give you a list of the five users to pick from. There will be no password required. When you click on a user, you go into the main view, which displays the list of projects. When you click on a project, you open the Kanban board for that project. You're going to see the columns. You'll be able to drag and drop cards back and forth between different columns. You will see any cards that are assigned to you, the currently logged in user, in a different color from all the other ones, so you can quickly see yours. You can edit any comments that you make, but you can't edit comments that other people made. You can delete any comments that you made, but you can't delete comments anybody else made."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input 
   ’ Feature description provided: team productivity platform with Kanban boards
2. Extract key concepts from description 
   ’ Identify: actors (PM, engineers), actions (task management, commenting), data (projects, tasks, comments), constraints (no auth, predefined users)
3. For each unclear aspect: 
   ’ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers required - description is comprehensive
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section 
   ’ Clear user flow: user selection ’ project list ’ Kanban board ’ task management
5. Generate Functional Requirements 
   ’ Each requirement is testable and unambiguous
6. Identify Key Entities 
   ’ Users, Projects, Tasks, Comments, Status Columns
7. Run Review Checklist 
   ’ No ambiguities, implementation details removed, scope clearly bounded
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a team member, I want to access a simple productivity platform where I can view and manage tasks across projects using Kanban boards, so that I can track work progress and collaborate with my team without complex authentication barriers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application launches, **When** I view the user selection screen, **Then** I see exactly 5 predefined users (1 Product Manager, 4 Engineers) to choose from
2. **Given** I select a user, **When** I proceed to the main view, **Then** I see a list of exactly 3 sample projects available
3. **Given** I click on a project, **When** the Kanban board loads, **Then** I see 4 columns: "To Do", "In Progress", "In Review", and "Done"
4. **Given** I'm viewing a Kanban board, **When** I drag a task card between columns, **Then** the task status updates and the card moves to the target column
5. **Given** I'm viewing task cards, **When** I look at the board, **Then** cards assigned to me appear in a different color from other cards
6. **Given** I open a task card, **When** I add a comment, **Then** the comment is saved and displayed with unlimited comment capacity
7. **Given** I view my own comment, **When** I interact with it, **Then** I can edit or delete it, but cannot modify comments by other users
8. **Given** I'm editing a task card, **When** I change the assignee, **Then** I can select from any of the 5 predefined users

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a task has no assignee? System should allow unassigned tasks
- What happens when a user tries to access the system directly without user selection? System should redirect to user selection screen
- What happens when a task has many comments? System should handle unlimited comments with proper display/scrolling

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a user selection screen displaying exactly 5 predefined users (1 Product Manager, 4 Engineers)
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow user selection without password or authentication requirements
- **FR-003**: System MUST display exactly 3 sample projects in the main view after user selection
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide Kanban boards with exactly 4 columns: "To Do", "In Progress", "In Review", "Done"
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable drag-and-drop functionality for moving task cards between status columns
- **FR-006**: System MUST visually distinguish task cards assigned to the current user with different colors
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow unlimited comments on any task card
- **FR-008**: System MUST restrict comment editing and deletion to the comment author only
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow task assignment to any of the 5 predefined users
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist task status changes when cards are moved between columns
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain user context throughout the session (selected user remains active)
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide task card interfaces for status modification, user assignment, and commenting

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents team members with role (Product Manager or Engineer), name, and identification for task assignment and comment authorship
- **Project**: Represents work containers with name, description, and associated task collections
- **Task**: Represents work items with title, description, current status (column), assigned user, and creation metadata
- **Comment**: Represents task discussions with content, author, timestamp, and edit/delete permissions based on authorship
- **Status Column**: Represents workflow stages ("To Do", "In Progress", "In Review", "Done") with ordering and task containment
